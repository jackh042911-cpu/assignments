## GitHub Pages preview

This repo contains a static `index.html` site that can be published with GitHub Pages.

### One-time repo settings

1. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.

### Publish / update

Push to the default branch. The included workflow deploys the site to GitHub Pages, and the public URL will be shown in the workflow summary once the deployment completes.
